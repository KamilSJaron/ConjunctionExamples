The test was formulated as:

"The decrease in correlation between gene frequency fluctuations under migration, heterozygote advantage, and drift have to be according the prediction of Malecot (1948)."

which is not completely clear without an access to the original publication (that is by the way written in French). We were not able to directly address this point, since we do not have an access to the publication. However, correct implementation of migration is proved in (V03)[../V03_collapse] and drift is already verified in (V01)[../V01_gene_frequency_variance_under_drift].

If anybody formalize this test, we will happily perform it.
