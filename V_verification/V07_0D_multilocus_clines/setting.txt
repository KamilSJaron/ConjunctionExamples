# # is the comment symbol, everything after # will be ignored, do not hesitate to write down notes
# The syntax is "NAMEofPARAMETER = VALUE;". Change only VALUE, correct reading of this file by simulation program is depended on it.
# all the parameters are set to the default values, range of the reasonable values is in comment after every parameter in the format [min,max]
# values out of recommended range are allowed, but without guarantee of successful simulation
